# Cave design notes

## Pertinent attributes

Deciding what types of cave levels to generate means identifying the salient
features which define different parameters.

  - Map size: scrolling or single-screen?
  - Room size
  - Number of rooms
  - Connectedness

## Examples from the roguelike canon

Brogue: 80x40, non-scrolling caves. Resizable from a minimum window size to fullscreen
Nethack: similar, but rectangular rooms connected by tunnels


## TODO

Why, when using the same seed each time, am I getting different caves? @TailRecursive?

Why, when holding down a movement, does the floor not get repainted sometimes?
