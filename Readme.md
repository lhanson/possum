# Possum

A trash-eating game engine.

# Overview

A major guiding principle behind Possum is that the game engine is decoupled
from UI concerns. That allows any given game to easily swap out UI approaches
without a ripple effect throughout the rest of the game, and ensures that
the engine design is abstracted well for a variety of use cases.

a short list:

    * Main event loop
    * Decoupled messaging paradigm to avoid direct dependencies between components/modules
    * ...
